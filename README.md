## Getting Off the Ground

The best way to learn and improve is by doing what you can first and then building off of it so lets go!
Little bit of a blank slate at the moment so here are the to dos

1. Post one of our inspired visualizations 
2. see if there is a way to make an actual checklist
3. create some pages to act as individual entries for projects. ie navigation I'm guessing
4. Fill in a project, eg. exploring how to use different chart types or insights into special interests.Maybe recreating visualizations I found interesting

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/EmmaHomme/datadventure/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
